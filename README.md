#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software Engineering is a discipline that involves the application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, maintenance, and management of software systems.
It is essential to the technology industry because it underpins the development of reliable, efficient, and secure software systems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Early programming - 1940s - 1950s: Development of early computers which were programmed using machine code and assembly language, and introduction of higher - level languages such as Fortran and COBOL which made programming more accessible and efficient.
- Software Crisis and Structured programming - 1960s - 1970s: Emergence of structured programming methodologies, such as those promoted by Edsger Dijkstra and others, which emphasised modular design and clear control of flow to address software complexity.
Formal Methods and methodologies -1980s: Introduction of methodologies like Waterfall.
- Object-Oriented programming and Agile movement -1990s: Rise of languages like C++ and Java, which introduced concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to improve software modularity and reuse.
- Publication of Agile Manifesto, which emphasised iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility over traditional, rigid methodologies. This led to adoption of Agile practices like Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP).
- DevOps and Continuous Integration/Continuous Development -2000s: Integration of development and operations to improve collaboration and automate the deployment process.
Modern Software Engineering practices - 2010s-present: Adoption of microservices architecture, which decomposes applications into small loosely-coupled services that can be developed and deployed independently.
- Introduction of the first version of the International Software Engineering Institute Capability Maturity Model Integration for software development, providing a framework for improving software development processes.
- Ongoing advancements including machine learning and AI.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement analysis - understand and document what the software should do and how it should perform.
Planning - define the scope, schedule, and resources needed for the project.
Design - create a blueprint for how the software will be constructed.
Implementation - write the actual code for the software according to the design specifications.
Testing - verify that the software functions correctly and meets the specified requirements.
Deployment - release the software to the production environment where it will be used by end-users.
Maintenance - address issues, make improvements, and update the software as needed.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a traditional project management approach that follows a linear sequence from beginning to end. It involves sequential phases. Applicable for large, complex projects with specific and unchanging requirements, and where thorough planning and documentation are critical.
Agile methodology is a modern and flexible approach that focuses on interactive and incremental development. It emphasises rapid iteration, autonomy, and flexibility.
Work is divided into time-based sprints of one-to-four weeks. Best for modern software development and product design projects with evolving requirements, allowing for continuous improvement and faster delivery



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - designing, coding, testing and maintaining software applications. Turns requirements into functional software by writing code and collaboration with other team members.
Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures that software meets quality standards and functions as expected.
Project Manager - oversees the entire software development lifecycle, ensuring projects are completed on time, within scope, and meeting quality standards.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software applications that combine essential tools for software development within a single graphical user interface. They streamline the coding process by integrating features like code editing, debugging, and build automation.
Examples: Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse.

A Version Control System manages changes to source code over time. It tracks revisions, facilitates collaboration, and ensures code integrity, and allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously.
Examples: Git, Mercurial



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
~ Managing changing requirements - requirements often change during development, leading to scope creep and potential delays.
~ Maintaining high quality code while meeting deadlines
~ Time management and meeting deadlines - balancing coding, testing, documentation, and meetings while meeting project deadlines.
~ Keeping up with evolving technology requires continuous learning and adaptation.
~ Effective collaboration and communication, especially in distributed teams can be challenging.
~ Dealing with technical debt - accumulating technical debt by cutting corners to meet deadlines can lead to long-term issues.

Solutions:
~ Adopt Agile practices, to accommodate changes through iterative development and regular feedback.
~ Implement regular code reviews to help catch errors early and improve overall code quality.
~ Break down tasks into smaller, manageable pieces and focus on high-priority items first.
~ Collaborate with peers and participate in tech communities to stay updated and learn from others.
~ Regular standups 



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - testing individual components or pieces of code (usually functions) in isolation. Each unit test verifies that a specific part of the code functions as expected.
      Importance:
      - Reduces debugging time by helping to catch errors early in the development cycle.
      - Improve code quality by helping write modular testable code.
Integration Testing - focuses on verifying the interaction between different units or modules of the software to ensure they work together as expected.
      Importance:
      - Check Interfaces: Ensures that different parts of the application interact correctly, focusing on data exchange and control flow between modules.
      - Detect Integration Issues: Identifies problems that arise when different units or systems are combined.
System testing - involves testing the complete, integrated software application as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements and works correctly in the intended environment.
      Importance:
      - Holistic Evaluation: Provides a comprehensive assessment of the system’s behavior and performance in a real-world context.
      - Detects System-Level Issues: Identifies issues that affect the software's overall functionality and performance, which may not be apparent during unit or integration testing.
      - End-to-End Testing: Tests the entire system’s functionality, including interactions between all integrated modules and external interfaces.
Acceptance testing - determines whether the software meets the acceptance criteria defined by stakeholders and is ready for deployment. It is often performed by end-users or QA teams.
      Importance:
      - Verify Usability: Confirms that the software meets user requirements and is usable in real-world scenarios.
      - User Satisfaction: Ensures the final product aligns with user expectations and requirements
      - Final Validation: Provides a final check before the software is released, ensuring it is ready for production use.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
The process of designing and refining prompts or queries to effectively interact with AI models. This process involves crafting inputs in a way that elicits the most accurate, relevant, and useful responses from the AI.
Importance:
- Enhanced Accuracy and Relevance
- Improved User Experience
- Mitigation of Misinterpretation
- Facilitation of Complex Interactions



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: "Tell me about marketing"
Issues: Lacks specificity - marketing is a very broad term, no clear focus, ambiguity. Marketing can mean different things in different contexts.

Improved: "Explain the key components of a digital marketing strategy for a small business looking to increase online sales."
The new prompt is more effective because it is specific - it clearly defines the subject area--digital marketing strategy--targeted at a particular type of business -small business, and a specific goal -increasing online sales, has clear focus -focusing on the key components of the strategy enables the Ai to break down the topic into essential elements, is concise -direct and to the point.
